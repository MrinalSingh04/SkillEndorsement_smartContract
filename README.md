# 🧠 Skill Endorsement Registry – Smart Contract
 
## What is it?

The **Skill Endorsement Registry** is a decentralized Solidity smart contract system that allows users to:

- Register themselves
- Add verifiable skill tags
- Receive endorsements from others
- Build on-chain reputation backed by optional staking 

## Why this matters 

In today’s digital world, credentials and endorsements are often centralized and unverifiable. This smart contract introduces a **transparent and trustless alternative**:

- Employers or platforms can **verify user skills and endorsements on-chain**
- Each endorsement is **immutable**, reducing false claims
- Optional staking adds **financial weight** to each endorsement
